Running the Application
To start the development server, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
or with Yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 to view the application in your browser.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm run dev: Starts the development server with HMR enabled.
npm run build: Builds the application for production in the dist folder.
npm run preview: Serves the production build locally for preview.
npm run lint: Runs ESLint to check for linting errors in the codebase.
Configuration
This project uses ESLint with default rules and can be customized based on your preferences. Additionally, you can switch between Babel and SWC plugins based on your needs for Fast Refresh in development:

Babel: Install and configure @vitejs/plugin-react.
SWC: Install and configure @vitejs/plugin-react-swc.
